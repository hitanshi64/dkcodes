        <h1><u>JAVA</u></h1>
        <p style="letter-spacing: 1px; padding-left: 15px; font-size: large;">Our core Java programming tutorial is designed for students and working professionals. Java is an object-oriented, class-based, concurrent, secured and general-purpose computer-programming language. It is a widely used robust technology.

        <h2>What is java?</h2>
        <p style="letter-spacing: 1px; padding-left: 15px; font-size: large;">Java is a <b>programming language</b> and a <b>platform</b>. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.<br><br>Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.</p>

        <h2>History of java:</h2>

        <p style="letter-spacing: 1px; padding-left: 15px; font-size: large;">The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.<br><br>

            The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started the project in the early '90s.
